# Evens or Odds card game
## Uses API, react, redux

User guesses if the next card will be even or odd. Their longest winning streak is stored,
and a record is stored in local storage.

A single deck of 52 cards, 4 suits is called from http://deckofcardsapi.com 


Created components, actions and reducers for the Deck, Instructions,
Draw Card, Card, Guess, Track Correct Guesses and keep a Record using Local Storage
